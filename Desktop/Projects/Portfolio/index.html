    <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
    <p><em>"Technology is not just about code or machines ‚Äî it's about people. It's about making everyday life smoother, solving real-world problems, and telling stories in a way that connects. I believe even a line of code can carry emotion, and that‚Äôs how I approach both writing and development."</em></p>
    
    <p>Below are a few creative writing pieces where I blend the logic of programming with the heart of storytelling ‚Äî showing that good tech begins with empathy, not syntax</p>
    </p>

    <h3>‚úçÔ∏è Why the World Needs Better Error Messages</h3>
    <p><em>Ever been hit with a ‚Äú404 Not Found‚Äù and felt personally attacked? Error messages shouldn‚Äôt sound like doors slamming in your face. They should guide, not confuse. In this short piece, I explored how even one line of copy can change the way users feel about a website ‚Äî and why writing matters just as much as code!</em></p>
    
<h3>‚úçÔ∏è When Code Breaks Me (and I Still Come Back)</h3>
    <p><em>
Writing and coding aren‚Äôt so different. Both start with nothing and end with structure, impact, and clarity. I once spent 5 hours debugging a JavaScript error, and what came out of it was more than just a fixed page ‚Äî it was a deeper understanding of persistence. That turned into this short blog-style story!</em></p>
    
<h3>‚úçÔ∏è Design, but Make it Human</h3>
    <p><em>
I love building things ‚Äî websites, layouts, flows. But I also love asking: ‚ÄúWill this make someone smile?‚Äù In this piece, I broke down how I think through the user‚Äôs eyes when creating interfaces, blending empathy with aesthetics!</em></p>
